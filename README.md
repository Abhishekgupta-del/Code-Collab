# CodeCollab


Real-time CodeEditor web application built with socket.io here any person can create a room by generating a unique room id and or can join a room by entering a username and passing the room id. Anyone can then utilize it for real-time coding needs. Useful for coding interviews and solving problems with friends.
In this code editor different users can simultaneously work on code, scripts and projects by creating a room secured through unique id from uuid v4 npm package. and here users can work, share and contribute to the code or scripts in real time. Only authorised persons who are part of the group(room) can view and contribute to the code.
I have try to built something different but stiil need help. Any person help me to add database feature to this app,So that user leave the room or close the window accidently then code of that room will preserved in database.
